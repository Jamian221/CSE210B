In this program, I created activity.cs as a parent class and had Breathing, listing, and Reflecting.cs as child classes. I also had a menu class to manage the menu. The activity class has the basic structure for each activity such as SetActivityTime(), Animation(), GetReady(), Start/EndMessage(), and GetActivityTime(). It also has variables for the activity name and description that the child classes set. The program starts by creating a menu object and using it to display the menu and get the selection. For each activity when it's selected, it creates an object of that activity, displays the start message, description, sets the time, gets ready, does the activity, and then displays the end message. After each activity completes it sends you back to the menu where you can do another activity or quit.
