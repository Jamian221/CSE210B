The program will create a menu object and a Goals object and then go into a loop where it will display the menu and allow you to choose an option with menu.DisplayMenu() and menu.GetInput(). It will then run through a switch statement that goes through each of the menu options. The first is to list the goals. This will use the Goals.ListGoals() which will run through the list of goals in the goals class and print each of them with their completion status (Goal.ReturnStatus) and name (Goal.ReturnInfo). The second is to save the goals. This will use Goals.SaveToFile() which will run through the list of goals and use the goal.ToString() to compile them into a list that can be saved into a file. The third option is to load goals from a file which will use the Goals.ReadFromFile(). This runs through the file and adds each object found into the list of goals with all of the information using the goal constructors. The record even will list the unfinished goals and allow you to mark them done with the goal.MarkComplete() (this will change the _complete var or _timesDone var depending on goal type) function that will be different for each goal type. the last option is quit which will call menu.quit which breaks you from the loop and ends the program.
